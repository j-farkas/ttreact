## Description

The card minigame from Final Fantasy VIII. Each player is dealt a random starting hand and places them on the board, starting with the blue player. If a card's strength to one side is higher than the adjacent card's strength, the adjacent card is captured upon placement. Whichever player controls more cards at the end is the winner.
